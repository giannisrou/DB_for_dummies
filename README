 Download and Run Web App:
8.	Make sure you have installed the NodeJs either from the command line (brew install npm) or manually by installing the packages given by the following site: https://nodejs.org/en/download/
(Mac/Windows/Unix compatible)  
9.	Make sure you have also installed a tool for coding such as Virtual Studio Code and that you have opened a directory called db-project, there:
Open a new terminal and add the following commands in the given order:
~npm init 
~npm install express
~ejsmysql2 custom-env
~npm install nodemon 
And to (or here in the command line you can also add the following command) ~cd db-project
~npm start 


In specific file called database.js you should add your own credentials in order to be able to connect the app with the database, specifically: 

Host:”localhost”
Port:3306 
User: root
Password: (write here if it exists)
Database:”DatabaseForDummies”

*These are for the MySQL Workbench (if you are using a different visual tool, then you will have to fill with different values depending on the port and the respective requirements of the application.
